# ‘Is it so with all?’ he asked

‘It is so with all,’ answered the weaver, ‘with the young as well as with the old, with the women as well as with the men, with the little children as well as with those who are stricken in years.  The merchants grind us down, and we must needs do their bidding.  The priest rides by and tells his beads, and no man has care of us.  Through our sunless lanes creeps Poverty with her hungry eyes, and Sin with his sodden face follows close behind her.  Misery wakes us in the morning, and Shame sits with us at night.  But what are these things to thee?  Thou art not one of us.  Thy face is too happy.’  And he turned away scowling, and threw the shuttle across the loom, and the young King saw that it was threaded with a thread of gold.

And a great terror seized upon him, and he said to the weaver, ‘What robe is this that thou art weaving?’

‘It is the robe for the coronation of the young King,’ he answered; ‘what is that to thee?’

And the young King gave a loud cry and woke, and lo! he was in his own chamber, and through the window he saw the great honey-coloured moon hanging in the dusky air.

 
And he fell asleep again and dreamed, and this was his dream.

He thought that he was lying on the deck of a huge galley that was being rowed by a hundred slaves.  On a carpet by his side the master of the galley was seated.  He was black as ebony, and his turban was of crimson silk.  Great earrings of silver dragged down the thick lobes of his ears, and in his hands he had a pair of ivory scales.

The slaves were naked, but for a ragged loin-cloth, and each man was chained to his neighbour.  The hot sun beat brightly upon them, and the negroes ran up and down the gangway and lashed them with whips of hide.  They stretched out their lean arms and pulled the heavy oars through the water.  The salt spray flew from the blades.

At last they reached a little bay, and began to take soundings.  A light wind blew from the shore, and covered the deck and the great lateen sail with a fine red dust.  Three Arabs mounted on wild asses rode out and threw spears at them.  The master of the galley took a painted bow in his hand and shot one of them in the throat.  He fell heavily into the surf, and his companions galloped away.  A woman wrapped in a yellow veil followed slowly on a camel, looking back now and then at the dead body.

As soon as they had cast anchor and hauled down the sail, the negroes went into the hold and brought up a long rope-ladder, heavily weighted with lead.  The master of the galley threw it over the side, making the ends fast to two iron stanchions.  Then the negroes seized the youngest of the slaves and knocked his gyves off, and filled his nostrils and his ears with wax, and tied a big stone round his waist.  He crept wearily down the ladder, and disappeared into the sea.  A few bubbles rose where he sank.  Some of the other slaves peered curiously over the side.  At the prow of the galley sat a shark-charmer, beating monotonously upon a drum.

After some time the diver rose up out of the water, and clung panting to the ladder with a pearl in his right hand.  The negroes seized it from him, and thrust him back.  The slaves fell asleep over their oars.

Again and again he came up, and each time that he did so he brought with him a beautiful pearl.  The master of the galley weighed them, and put them into a little bag of green leather.

The young King tried to speak, but his tongue seemed to cleave to the roof of his mouth, and his lips refused to move.  The negroes chattered to each other, and began to quarrel over a string of bright beads.  Two cranes flew round and round the vessel.

Then the diver came up for the last time, and the pearl that he brought with him was fairer than all the pearls of Ormuz, for it was shaped like the full moon, and whiter than the morning star.  But his face was strangely pale, and as he fell upon the deck the blood gushed from his ears and nostrils.  He quivered for a little, and then he was still.  The negroes shrugged their shoulders, and threw the body overboard.

And the master of the galley laughed, and, reaching out, he took the pearl, and when he saw it he pressed it to his forehead and bowed.  ‘It shall be,’ he said, ‘for the sceptre of the young King,’ and he made a sign to the negroes to draw up the anchor.

And when the young King heard this he gave a great cry, and woke, and through the window he saw the long grey fingers of the dawn clutching at the fading stars.

 
And he fell asleep again, and dreamed, and this was his dream.

He thought that he was wandering through a dim wood, hung with strange fruits and with beautiful poisonous flowers.  The adders hissed at him as he went by, and the bright parrots flew screaming from branch to branch.  Huge tortoises lay asleep upon the hot mud.  The trees were full of apes and peacocks.

On and on he went, till he reached the outskirts of the wood, and there he saw an immense multitude of men toiling in the bed of a dried-up river.  They swarmed up the crag like ants.  They dug deep pits in the ground and went down into them.  Some of them cleft the rocks with great axes; others grabbled in the sand.

They tore up the cactus by its roots, and trampled on the scarlet blossoms.  They hurried about, calling to each other, and no man was idle.

From the darkness of a cavern Death and Avarice watched them, and Death said, ‘I am weary; give me a third of them and let me go.’  But Avarice shook her head.  ‘They are my servants,’ she answered.

And Death said to her, ‘What hast thou in thy hand?’

‘I have three grains of corn,’ she answered; ‘what is that to thee?’

‘Give me one of them,’ cried Death, ‘to plant in my garden; only one of them, and I will go away.’

‘I will not give thee anything,’ said Avarice, and she hid her hand in the fold of her raiment.

And Death laughed, and took a cup, and dipped it into a pool of water, and out of the cup rose Ague.  She passed through the great multitude, and a third of them lay dead.  A cold mist followed her, and the water-snakes ran by her side.

And when Avarice saw that a third of the multitude was dead she beat her breast and wept.  She beat her barren bosom, and cried aloud.  ‘Thou hast slain a third of my servants,’ she cried, ‘get thee gone.  There is war in the mountains of Tartary, and the kings of each side are calling to thee.  The Afghans have slain the black ox, and are marching to battle.  They have beaten upon their shields with their spears, and have put on their helmets of iron.  What is my valley to thee, that thou shouldst tarry in it?  Get thee gone, and come here no more.’

‘Nay,’ answered Death, ‘but till thou hast given me a grain of corn I will not go.’

But Avarice shut her hand, and clenched her teeth.  ‘I will not give thee anything,’ she muttered.

And Death laughed, and took up a black stone, and threw it into the forest, and out of a thicket of wild hemlock came Fever in a robe of flame.  She passed through the multitude, and touched them, and each man that she touched died.  The grass withered beneath her feet as she walked.

And Avarice shuddered, and put ashes on her head.  ‘Thou art cruel,’ she cried; ‘thou art cruel.  There is famine in the walled cities of India, and the cisterns of Samarcand have run dry.  There is famine in the walled cities of Egypt, and the locusts have come up from the desert.  The Nile has not overflowed its banks, and the priests have cursed Isis and Osiris.  Get thee gone to those who need thee, and leave me my servants.’

‘Nay,’ answered Death, ‘but till thou hast given me a grain of corn I will not go.’

‘I will not give thee anything,’ said Avarice.

And Death laughed again, and he whistled through his fingers, and a woman came flying through the air.  Plague was written upon her forehead, and a crowd of lean vultures wheeled round her.  She covered the valley with her wings, and no man was left alive.

And Avarice fled shrieking through the forest, and Death leaped upon his red horse and galloped away, and his galloping was faster than the wind.

And out of the slime at the bottom of the valley crept dragons and horrible things with scales, and the jackals came trotting along the sand, sniffing up the air with their nostrils.

And the young King wept, and said: ‘Who were these men, and for what were they seeking?’

‘For rubies for a king’s crown,’ answered one who stood behind him.
